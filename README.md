# Smart-stick-for-blind-people
The purpose of this
project is to design a smart cane with ultrasonic sensor ,Arduino and NODEMCU. This
embedded system mainly has two parts, mobility and navigation system. For mobility
system, it is equipped with ultrasonic sensor, HCSR04 and vibrating motor. Ultrasonic
sensor will send the trigger pulse to detect obstacles. When an obstacle is detected,
signals will be sent to Buzzer and activate it. The vibrating motor will vibrate when
Rain sensor becomes wet and it gives a command of Water through Speaker. The
microcontroller used in this embedded system is Arduino UNO and the NODEMCUESP8266
WIFI development board . The prototype of smart cane was built to increase
the mobility of the blind people and with navigation system using Blynk IoT App
